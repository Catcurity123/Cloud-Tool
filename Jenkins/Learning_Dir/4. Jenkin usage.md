#### A.

(+) Jenkin files are located at `/var/jenkins_home/workspace/` 
(+) Jenkin build information are located at `/var/jenkins_home/jobs/<name>/builds`

#### B. How to set up Jenkins nodes
(+) Before we can set up the configuration for worker node on the master node, we need to ensure that these node can communicate with each other.

`1.` `sudo mkdir /var/lib/jenkins`: We need to make a directory for jenkin as it is not default configuration>
`2.` `sudo useradd -d /var/lib/jenkins jenkins`: we need to  create a user to use the directory
`3.` `sudo chown jenkins:jenkins /var/lib/jenkins`: We also need to provide the user with appropriate permission
`4.` `ssh-keygen`: we need to create a keypair for master and worker node
`5.` `mkdir /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh` then `copy the key from ./.ssh/id_rsa.pub` to the directory on jenkins folder which is `/var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/authorized_keys`
`6.` `sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk`: to install the developing environment.
`7.` `cat ./.ssh/id_rsa`: Copy private key from the worker node
`8.` Configure on the master node:

`9.` However, the worker node is unable to start because it is not in the known host of each other

###### Therefore, we need to ssh to the worker node from the master node to make it a known host to the master node

###### When the worker node is already in the known host of the master node, we need to copy the known host file on the master node to the worker node.

`1.` `scp ./.ssh/known_hosts cloud_user@13.52.74.135:/tmp/`: If the worker node deny our permission, we can copy the file onto a temporary folder.
`2.` `ssh cloud_user@13.52.74.135`: Then ssh onto the worker node
`3.` `sudo mv /tmp/known_hosts /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/`: Then we can copy the file from the temporary folder to the folder we want.
