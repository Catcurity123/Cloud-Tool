#### A. What is Test Driven Development (TDD)
(+) Tests are written first, Usually these are unit tests that satisfy software requirements. Then code is written to make the tests pass.

(+) There are also other test types:
	(-) `Smoke test`: This is a quick test to ensure that the most important functions of a build are working, or that the build is stable.
	(-) `Functional test`: Does it do what it is supposed to do?
	(-) `Acceptance Testing`: Does the end product meet the requirements that are outlined in the design document? Is the software acceptable to the end user
	(-) `Unit Test`: This is the testing of individual parts or units of the software. A unit is the smallest testable part of the software.
