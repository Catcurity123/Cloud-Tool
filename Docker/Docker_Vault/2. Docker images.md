#### A. What is an image
(+) Docker image is the source of a container.
(+) `Image comprised of layers`, all code, runtime, libs, variables, and configuration are supplied via a layered Dockerfile.
(+) `Layers are cached`, this means images are more reusable quicker to deploy, and take up less space than a standard virtual machine image
(+) `Everything` the `container needs to perform` its job successfully should be `added to the image`.
(+) Image can have a `parent image`, on which they are based. Image with no parent are called base images.
