#### A. Why containerization?
(+) Containers are all about making app simple to build, ship, and run
(+) The following steps are generally used:
	1. Start with your application code and dependencies 
	2. Create a Dockerfile that describes your app, its dependencies, and how to run it 
	3. Feed the Dockerfile into the docker image build command 
	4. Push the new image to a registry (optional) 
	5. Run container from the image
