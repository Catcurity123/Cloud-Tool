#### A. What is Docker Engine
(+) The Docker engine is modular in design and built from many small specialised tools. Where possible, these are based on open standards such as those maintained by the Open Container Initiative (OCI).

(+) The major components that make up the Docker engine are; `the Docker daemon`, `containerd`, `runc`, and various plugins such as `networking` and `storage`. Together, these create and run containers.

#### B. Originally
(+) The Docker daemon was a monolithic binary. It contained all of the code for the Docker client, the Docker API, the container runtime, image builds, and much more. 

(+) LXC provided the daemon with access to the fundamental building-blocks of containers that existed in the Linux kernel. Things like namespaces and control groups (cgroups).

#### D. Runc
(+) Runc is the reference implementation of the OCI container-runtime-spec. Docker, Inc. was heavily involved in defining the spec and developing runc.

==> runc has a single purpose in life — create containers. And it’s damn good at it. And fast!


#### E. Containerd
(+) Its sole purpose in life was to manage container lifecycle operations — start | stop | pause | rm....

(+) As previously stated, containerd was originally intended to be small, lightweight, and designed for a single task in life — `container lifecycle operations`. However, over time it has branched out and taken on more functionality. Things like image `pulls`, `volumes` and `networks`.

(+) For example, in projects like `Kubernetes`, it was beneficial for containerd to do additional things like `push` and `pull images`. For these reasons, containerd now does a lot more than simple container lifecycle.

#### F. The starting of a new container
(+) The most common way of starting containers is using `Docker CLI`, when we type `docker container run --name ctr1 -it alpine:latest sh`.

(+) When you type commands like this into the Docker CLI, the Docker client converts them into the appropriate API payload and POSTs them to the API endpoint exposed by the Docker daemon.

(+) Linux the socket is : `/var/run/docker.sock`
(+) Window is: `\pipe\docker_engine`

(+) Once the daemon receives the command to create a new container, it makes a call to containerd. Remember that the daemon no-longer contains any code to create containers!

(+) The daemon communicates with containerd via a CRUD-style API over gRPC.

(+) It converts the required Docker image into an OCI bundle and tells runc to use this to create a new container.

(+) Runc interfaces with the OS kernel to pull together all of the constructs necessary to create a container (namespaces, cgroups etc.). The container process is started as a child - process of runc, and as soon as it is started runc will exit.

###### What is shim?
(+) Once a container’s parent runc process exits, the associated containerd-shim process becomes the container’s parent. Some of the responsibilities the shim performs as a container’s parent include: 
	(-) Keeping any STDIN and STDOUT streams open so that when the daemon is restarted, the container doesn’t terminate due to pipes being closed etc. 
	(-) Reports the container’s exit status back to the daemon.

#### G. How is it implemented on Linux
(+) On a Linux system, the components we’ve discussed are implemented as separate binaries as follows: 
	(-) Dockerd (the Docker daemon) 
	(-) Docker-containerd (containerd) 
	(-) Docker-containerd-shim (shim) 
	(-) Docker-runc (runc)
