#### A. Containers vs VMs
(+) Containers and VMs both need a host to run on. This can be anything from your laptop, a bare metal server in your data center, all the way up to an instance in the public cloud.


###### In VM model
(+) The physical server is powered on and the hypervisor boots (we’re skipping the BIOS and bootloader code etc.). Once booted, the hypervisor lays claim to all physical resources on the system such as CPU, RAM, storage, and NICs.

(+) It then carves these hardware resources into virtual versions that look smell and feel exactly like the real thing. It then packages them into a software construct called a virtual machine (VM)

###### In container model
(+) The server is powered on and the OS boots. In the Docker world this can be Linux, or a modern version of Windows that supports the container primitives in its kernel. Similar to the VM model, the OS claims all hardware resources.

(+) On top of the OS, we install a container engine such as Docker. The container engine then takes OS resources such as the process tree, the filesystem, and the network stack, and carves them into isolated constructs called containers.

==> At a high level, hypervisors perform hardware virtualization — they carve up physical hardware resources into virtual versions called VMs

==> Containers perform OS virtualization — they carve OS resources into virtual versions called containers

#### B. Container Lifecycle
(+) `docker run --name <name> -it <repo>:<tag> <app or command>`: To run the container the first time
(+) `docker start -i <container_id>`: To run the container subseqeuntly
(+) `docker stop + <container_name>`: to stop a container
this will put the container in `exited mode`
(+) `docker rm + <container_name>`: This will remove the container entirely and destroy the data within the container.

==> Container are designed to be `immutable objects` and it's not a good practice to write data to them. We can fix this by using `volumes`.

(+) `docker container run --name <containername> -it --restart always alpine sh`: This will restart the container always after we exit
