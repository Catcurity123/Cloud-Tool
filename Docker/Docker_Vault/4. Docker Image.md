#### A. What need to know about docker image

(+) A Docker image is a unit of packaging that contains everything required for an application to run. 
==> This includes: `application code`, `application dependencies`, and `OS constructs`.

==> Images are considered `build-time constructs`, whereas containers are `run-time constructs`.

#### B. Image registries
(+) Image registries contain one or more `image repositories`. In turn image repositories contain one or more images.

###### Image naming and tagging
(+) `docker image pull <repository/<additional_info>:<tag>`: 
==> `docker image pull dixluwn/webapp:v1.0`

(+) If we dont specify tag, `docker` will assume that it is latest.

#### C. Search from CLI
(+) `docker search + <search_info>`: How to search for image from CLI


#### D. Docker Layer
(+) A Docker image is just a bunch of loosely-connected read-only layers, with each layer comprising one or more files
(+) Docker takes care of stacking these layers and representing them as a single unified object.

(+) `docker image inspect + <image name>`: To inspect an image

(+) All Docker images start with a base layer, and as changes are made and new content is added, new layers are added on top.
==> Consider the following oversimplified example of building a simple `Python application`. You might have a corporate policy that `all applications are based on the official Ubuntu 20:04 image`. This would be your `imageâ€™s base layer`. If you then add the `Python package`, this will be added as a second layer on top of the base layer. If you later `add source code files`, these will be added as additional layers.
