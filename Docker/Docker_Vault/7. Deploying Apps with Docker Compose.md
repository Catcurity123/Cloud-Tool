#### A. Why?
(+) Modern cloud-native apps are made of multiple smaller services that interact to form a useful app. This is what we called `microservices`
(+) Deploying and managing lots of small microservices like these can be hard. This is where `Docker COmposes` comes into play
==> Instead of gluing each microservice together with scripts and long `docker` commands, Docker Compose lets use descrive an entire app in a single declarative configuration file, and deploy it with a single command.

#### B. Docker Compose
(+) We define multi-container (microservices) apps in a YAML file, pass the YAML file to the docker-compose command line, and Compose deploys it via the Docker API.

(+) The first thing to note is that the file has 4 top-level keys: 
- version
- services 
- networks 
- volumes
