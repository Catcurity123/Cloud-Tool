#### A. What does it take to construct a system using playbooks

###### 1. Package management
(+) What packages will our system need? Install all packages needed to run our system.
==> Patching
==> Package manager

``` example_playbook
---
	- hosts: loadbalancers
	  tasks:
	  - name: Install apache
	    yum: name=httpd state=latest
```

###### 2. Configure Infrastructure
(+) Configure our system with necessary application files or configuration files that are needed to configure environment.
==> Copy files
==> Edit configuration files

``` example_playbook
---
	- host: loadbalancers
	  tasks:
		  - name: Copy config file
		    copy: src=/config.cfg dest=/etc/config.cfg

	- host: webservers
	  tasks:
		  - name: Synchronize folders
		    synchronize: src=./app dest=/var/www/html/app
```

###### 3. Service handlers
(+) Create service handlers to start, stop, or restart our system when changes are made
==> command
==> service
==> handlers

```example_playbooks
---
	- hosts: loadbalancers
	  tasks:
		  - name: Configure port number
		    lineinfile: path=/etc/config.cfg regexp='^port' line ='port=80'
		    notify: Restart apache

	  handlers:
		  - name: Restart apache
		    service: name=httpd status=restarted
```
