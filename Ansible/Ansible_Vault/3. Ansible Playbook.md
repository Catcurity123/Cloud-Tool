#### A. What are Playbooks
(+) Playbooks are a way to congregate ordered processes and manage configuration needed to build out a remote system.

==> Playbooks make configuration management easy and gives us the ability to deploy to a multi-machine setup
==> Playbooks can decalre configuration and orchestrate steps (normally done in a manual ordered process), and, when run, can ensure our remote system is configured as expected
==> The written tasks within a playbook can be run synchronously or asynchronously.
==> Playbooks gives us the ability to create infrastructure as code and manage it all in source control

#### B. How to write a playbook
(+) List out everything we want to apply to each instance
(+) Group them according tto configuration usage
(+) Ensure they are in a logically defined order
(+) Run each tasks according to the order they are listed

#### C. Playbooks properties
(+) Playbooks use YAML syntax which allows you to model a configuration or a process
(+) Playbooks are composed of one or more `plays` in a list
(+) The goal of a `play` is to map a group of host (defined in our `inventory file`) to  a `tasks` that are used to call Ansible module.
(+) By composing a playbook of multiple play, it makes it possible to orchestrate multi-machine deployments and allows us to run certain steps on all machines in a group.

###### Playbook sample
``` ping_playbook
# ping.yml
---
 - hosts: all
   tasks:
   -  name: Pinging all servers
      action: ping
```

(+) We can run this play book using `ansible-playbook ping.yml`

==> `Play [webservers]`: refers to the hosts that our playbooks executes upon
==> `Task [gathering facts]`: refers to ansible logging into each instance to gather information for later use (this can be disabled)
==> `Task [pinging all servers]`: refers to ansible pinging each instance
==> `Play Recap`: refers to summary of the play


``` uname-a_playbook
---
- hosts: webservers:loadbalancers
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Get OS type
      shell: uname -a
      register: uname_output

    - name: Display OS type
      debug:
        var: uname_output.stdout
```

==> In Ansible, when you execute a task, the standard output (stdout) of that task is not automatically displayed in the playbook execution output.

(+) To capture and display the output of a task, such as the output of the `uname -a` command in your case, you have to explicitly instruct Ansible to do so. This is where the `register` keyword comes in.

(+) When you use `register`, you're telling Ansible to store the result of the task (in this case, the output of the `uname -a` command) into a variable. Then, in a subsequent task, you can use the `debug` module to display the content of that variable.
