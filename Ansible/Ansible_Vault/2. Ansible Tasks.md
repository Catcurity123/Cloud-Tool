#### A. What is Ansible Tasks
(+) Ansible tasks are a way to run adhoc commands against our inventory in a one-line single executable. Tasks are the basic building blocks of Ansible's execution and configuration

(+) Commands consist of the Ansible command, options, and host-pattern
(+) Example of pinging all the hosts associated with our inventory
(+) The results returned will give us important information about the execution of the end host

#### B. Some other Ansible properties for ansible.cfg

```ansible_configuration
# ansible.cfg

[defaults]

inventory = ./hosts-dev

remote_user = ec2-user

private_key_file = ~/.ssh/Ansible_Test_Key.pem

host_key_checking = False


# Windows only users

[ssh_connection]

ssh_args = -o ControlMaster=no
```

(+) `remote_user`: This refers to the username that will be used to ssh
(+) `private_key_file`: This refers to the private key that will be used to ssh
(+) `host_key_checking`: When set to False, this means that the system will not prompt for confirmation.

#### C. Ansible's module command
==> With the above setup, we can run the command `ansible -m ping all`, to ping all hosts inour hosts-dev
